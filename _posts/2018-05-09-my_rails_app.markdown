You know that feeling you get when you realize that you may have just wasted a boat load of time for nothing?  Yeah, that feeling that makes your stomach drop as a tidal wave of anxiety pours over your head.  Well, about ten hours into my rails project, that feeling almost grounded me.  

I thought I had the right setup.  I thought my application was blue printed to perfection. The AR associations were fine-tuned, the data was going flow nicely, and everything was going to come together like a perfect Lego structure.  Unfortunately, programming doesn't always work out that way and I should know that by now.  Things will break, changes will be made, and adaptation will almost always play a pivotal role in development.  It's the beautiful, and at times, downright ugly, part of doing what we are learning to do here.

Now, I tend to write dramatically, so you probably thought I trashed the whole application.  Well, you're right, I did.  No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  I didn't do that but I almost did. Turns out, my planning was not exact but my intuition was.  I was bound and determined to make my web application happen, and I was even more driven to prove to myself that my schema would be just fine.  Through tons of backtracking the curriculum and pouring over stack overflow, my little donation website started to come alive.  And now, like I have the past two projects before, I get to come to the blog dashboard feeling victorious and ready to continue down the rabbit hole that is web development.

If you are reading this and feeling down, best advice I can give?

Just start coding and things will happen.
