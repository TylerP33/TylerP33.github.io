It has been a month since I started this wonderful program, and now that I am knee-deep in programming concepts and projects, I could not be happier.  After I graduated college with a political science degree, I avoided the fallback plan of all PS majors (law school), and settled on insurance sales.  Sales was not bad, and for a while there, I enjoyed the rush of closing a big deal.  But quickly, my loss of interest came rushing in, and my lack of self-worth came right behind it.  I was not feeling pushed, I was not enjoying what I was doing, and more importantly, I was not fulfilled.  Even though I knew all of these things, and they were tangible feelings that had been repeated in my head numerous times, I stayed around the industry for another four years.  Six years total.  Six years of not enjoying my job and floundering pushed me to new levels of desperation.  I soon began to realize that my job was affecting my marriage and it was changing me as a I person.  Those two things are what pushed me over the edge, and I knew it was time to dig deep and pursue a new career path.  

I started to analyze what hobbies of mine made me glow, and I really took a long look at anything that peaked my interest.  I have been a PC gamer for a good majority of my life.  When I say PC gamer, I mean to the highest extent.  From the age of eight and on, I was infatuated with computers.  Now, I did not do much formal programming when I was younger, but being on a computer for six hours every day teaches you, through osmosis, way more than you can imagine.  Looking back, I realized my knowledge of computers was far deeper than most of my peers, and just recently, I realized I had done some programming throughout my years of gaming.  Whether it was fooling around with graphics, or customizing GUI's for first-person shooting games, I have always tinkered with the internal workings.  Oddly enough, the time investment still never translated into a career path.  I have no idea if it was social pressure or me just being a late bloomer, but it never occured to me that I should pursue a job that had to do with computers.  That is until I found flatiron.

After doing months of research, and debating whether going back to school for a second degree was worth it, I stumbled upon the idea of coding boot camps.  After just a few days of looking into them, I knew it was the route I was going to take.  I vetted them out hard, and took my time in my research.  After two months, I fell in love with Flatiron.  And now, a month later, I can proudly say I am in love with Programming.  The pressure is on, and my family is counting on me to succeed at this.  With that said, my passion for programming and the guidance I have received from this program has made me 100% confident in my future.  I will be a software developer, and I will continue to push myself to new heights.
