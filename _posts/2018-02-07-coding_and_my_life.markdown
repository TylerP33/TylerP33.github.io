I find it very interesting that an activity that I knew so little about just a few months ago has become, not only a daily source of happiness, but a foundational pillar in my life.  Through a mix of habit forming techniques, a drive to complete the program, and an overall love for the act of coding, I have shifted my life into a much more purpose-driven gear.  Unfortunately, I am writing this blog a little late, but I find the timing somewhat endearing because I got to sit back and read what I wrote when I first started this program a few months back.  The excitement I felt back then was the "honeymoon" phase of programming.  I was going over Procedural Ruby and all it's cool concepts, all while writing up hundreds of notecards so that I could study later that night.  I was solving easy, yet rewarding, one or two method problems.  Iterate through this array, return this string without this character.  You know, the enticing labs that got all of us hooked from the start.  Those emotions were raw and expected, considering I was experiencing something brand new.  But like most ambitions in my life, the newness quickly faded as the difficulty picked up, and programming became much more serious.

I feel like the purpose of blogging is to be open, so I plan to do exactly that.  When Christmas rolled around, I had just begun OO Ruby and right from the start, I could feel the curriculum pick up.  Black and white concepts started to become very grey and blurred for me.  I would find myself reading and coding things over and over again, only to wake up the next day and feel like I had forgotten what I had just studied eight hours the day before.  At the time, the self-doubt was small, but it was definitely brewing inside and I did exactly what I shouldn't have done.  I decided to take a few weeks off from programming and enjoy my break with my family.  My wife was off work for a week and a half so I said what the heck, I will just put down the programming and take a break.  I mean, why not?  I had just worked my butt off for two months, studying 7-10 hours per day (including lesiure time programming reading).  What is the worst that could happen?  Well, turns out, a lot.  

When I came back to programming, my stomach dropped.  I was getting into some of the bigger OO labs and I felt like I had forgotten everything!  I sat there staring at these labs, the incomplete test specs growing a brighter red than normal, all while that seeded anxiety began to blossom.

"Oh my gosh, you don't know any of this!", I started to say myself.

After a few more weeks of sub-par "programming" here and there, completely straying away from the firm and efficient schedule I was on before Christmas, I came to a harsh realization.  I either needed to quit this program and stop wasting my money, or I needed to step up and dedicate myself to finishing this.  You see, it's not that I didn't love coding because I did... I truly fell in love with programming from the start.  But the steady flow of insecurities had killed my motivation and nearly convinced me that I am not worthy, nor am I smart enough to be a programmer.  You see, this is cyclical for me.  It has taken 29 years to figure this out but it's an all too familiar pattern.  I quit when things get hard.  I roll over, I convince myself said activity, or hobby, or whatever it may be, just isn't for me.  Then, a few years will fly by and I will look back and think "If only I would have done this better".

That moment came a month ago for me.  I wanted to quit and run away like I have always done.  But with age comes wisdom, and I knew better.  I knew I had to stick with it and I can't explain to you how big that was for me because now, here I am, having more fun than I was the first few months of starting this program.  I have broken through some tough conceptual barriers, I have put together a decent CLI-App that I am about to turn in and life feels good.

So, in short, I am blessed to have beat myself.  I am glad I am fighting for something that I love.
