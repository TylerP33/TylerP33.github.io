I am officially done with my Sinatra project and I must say, it is a little bit of a bittersweet moment for me.  I know this beautifully light framework may have a lot of uses but I also know that the next step in my Web Dev path will be to move on to bigger and better things.  I have to admit something, even though it may make me look a little bit foolish.  I joined this boot camp because I wanted to learn to "program".  Yes, I was that whimsical about it, and yes, and I was that ill-informed as to what programming meant.  I knew the web was a great place to show off your coding skills and I knew that a lot of jobs could be found in the web development field.  With that being said, I wasn't sold on programming as a Web Developer, even though I joined a full stack web development boot camp.  To summarize, I wasn't for sure if I was going to like building and working on websites.

Cue Sinatra.  Working with Sinatra was awesome.  Starting with the basics of how we interact with the web, all the way to learning about the databases that will hold all of our user's data; it was all so eloquent and enlightening.  Plowing through all those lessons and learning how to build a working website was way more exciting than I imagined, and I believe you guys at Flatiron knew that, hence the curriculum setup.  Sinatra has a lot of cool "magic" that helps design a website, but it doesn't get too crazy with it.  There is a lot of handy-work that goes into building a web application with Sinatra and for that reason, I learned to respect it as I learned more and more about it.  I am sure a lot of my fellow students feel this way, but finishing this Sinatra project really allows the light from the end of the tunnel to start creeping in.  If can learn Sinatra and build a decent web application on my own, then why can't I learn everything else that an employer will require of me?  Well, the simple answer is I can.  

By far the best thing about Flatiron is not the actual content of the curriculum, because like most of us know, that is all "open source" to a certain extent.  It's not the cool setup and the environment, although that plays a large part in the experience.  To me, it is the way the curriculum is laid out and it's the way all the information flows.  You can really see the detailed work that went into figuring out the most efficient and fast way to teach someone how to become a web developer.  That becomes more apparent as I approach the last leg of this program.

It has been one hell of an experience so far and I can't wait to get into Rails!
