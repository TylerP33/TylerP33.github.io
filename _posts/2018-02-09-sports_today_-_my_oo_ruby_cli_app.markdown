Well, my first official program is finally complete and man, does it feel good!  The concepts leading up to this point, and in reality, all of Object Oriented Ruby, definitely had me second-guessing my ability to learn programming.  There were some frustrating times that required more work than I anticipated, and most likely that derived from my underestimation of the curriculum.  Either way, I plowed through it and I am finally here!  I am on the cusp of heading to the next part of the program, and that is awesome.  All there is left to do now is get through the nerve-racking technical interview land then, proceed on full steam ahead!

When I finally got to this final project, I started with a few ideas that turned out to be a little too lofty for me.  I am not familiar with Javascript yet, nor do I know anything about AngularJS.  I came to that harsh conclusion when I picked, what I thought, was the perfect website for my project.  Unfortunately for me, I had already started setting up the CLI (like what Avi did in his little tutorial for us).  I had made sure everything flowed together fine (set up all the dependencies, and requirements) and I was well on my way!  That was until I tried to scrape the webpage.  Line after line of foreign text quickly dissolved my excitement and I was forced to rethink and restart my whole project.  So with that information, I decided to keep it simple, and do something within the scope of my knowledge.  Plus, I decided to write a program about a topic I am passionate about, and that is sports.

Cue the Sports Today App!  It is a simple little App that I made that tracks what sports are being televised that day, courtesy of www.tvguide.com .  The idea was to make an application that can let you see what is on that day based off the sport of your choosing.  If you were interested in seeing only the events that pertain to basketball, just type "basketball".  I thought by doing this, it strayed away from what the webpage had already done, and that was break the sports down by time of the day.  Although the application was not going to be as intricate or detailed as my first few ideas, I think it is clean and I am proud of it.  It does not break (as far as I know), and the functionality is flexible.  It's a cut and dry application that a user can hop on and use with ease, and as I am finding out, that is a very important aspect of programming.  We program the customer!  

Anyways, this experience has given me a nice boost of confidence and has got me pumped to keep learning.

Thanks Flatiron, for the nice path :D
